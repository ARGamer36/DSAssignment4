Compile Command:
    $ javac *.java
Run Command
    $ java SortDriver input.txt
        or
    $ java SortDriver

For the Sorting Algorithms I used the code provided in the slides to help me make them.

How SortDriver works:
    When you run the code you can input your own 10,000 size
    text file by adding it to the command line arguments.
    However, if you wish to generate your own randomly sized
    list of any size you don't put anything into the command line
    arguments. The program will then prompt you to input the size
    of the array and will then randomly generate a list of that size
    and then prompt you on which sorting algorithm you wish to use.
